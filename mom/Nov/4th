Automation Scripts

I showed the work done till now which was testing the installation of dependecies done using script.sh.
Some silly bugs were fixed because of which errors were shown before.

Next week, the work to be done(mandatory):

Test the script on all the possible test environments. Set up VMs to do that. This work needs to be completed.
(Non-negotibale).
